# Variational Autoencoder + hidden Markov model for Stellar Flare Detection

This repository provides the codebase required to run the full VAE+HMM framework presented in the following paper:

Herrera, R., Leos-Barajas, V., Eadie, G., Semenova, E., & Davenport, J. (2026). Scalable Bayesian Additive Models for Stellar Flare Detection via Amortized Gaussian Process Inference and Hidden Markov Models.

# PriorCVAE in JAX

The main VAE structure is based on the following two papers:

1. Elizaveta Semenova, Yidan Xu, Adam Howes, Theo Rashid, Samir Bhatt, Swapnil Mishra, Seth Flaxman["PriorVAE: encoding spatial priors with variational autoencoders for small-area estimation."](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsif.2022.0094) Journal of the Royal Society Interface 19.191 (2022): 20220094. Original code is avilable [here](https://github.com/elizavetasemenova/PriorVAE). 
2. Elizaveta Semenova, Prakhar Verma, Max Cairney-Leeming, Arno Solin, Samir Bhatt, Seth Flaxman ["PriorCVAE: scalable MCMC parameter inference with Bayesian deep generative modelling."](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04307) arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.04307 (2023). Original code is avilable [here](https://github.com/elizavetasemenova/PriorcVAE).

## Environment

We recommend setting up a [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) environment.
```shell
conda create -n prior_cvae -c conda-forge python==3.10.1
conda activate prior_cvae
```

Within the virtual environment, install the dependencies by running
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** The code has been tested with `Python 3.10.1`. There is a known issue with `Python 3.10.0` related to loading a saved model  because of the [bug](https://bugs.python.org/issue45416) which is resolved in `Python 3.10.1`. 

## Install the package

```shell
python setup.py install
```

To install in the develop mode:
```shell
python setup.py develop
```

## To runs tests

First install the test-requirements by running the following command from within the conda environment:
```shell
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```
Then, run the following command:
```shell
pytest -v tests/
```
